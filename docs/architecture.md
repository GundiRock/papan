- Client/Server architecture.
  - Probably using gRPC.
  - Desktop / web browser / Android / iOS clients.
    - Not sure if Android / iOS clients only fullscreen webpages.
- Notion of Global / Local views.
  - Global = the board visible by everyone, including spectators.
  - Local = player's hands and UI.
  - Global board should still be interactive, but only on each player's "turn".
    - Preemptivity of turns to allow interruptions.
- Lobby server in node.js.
  - May be a REST / Websocket gateway for web clients.
  - Spawns game instances (maybe C/Lua ?) in docker files for sandboxing when running on things that cost money.
    - Lobby server plays the role of the gateway.
    - gRPC uds sockets between the two, if possible.
  - Maybe running the game instance in plain-Lua-within-node.js when running everything on desktop (Electron, that is).
- Game logic in Lua, for portability (Android / iOS ?) and sandboxing.
- Game "packages" containing server Lua code, client Lua code, and assets.
  - Means we can't trust the packages.
- Replayability / game session recording.
  - Needs to have replayable "game states", aka the game server only retraces / resends events that happened (gRPC messages should be enough ?), and game clients become non-interactive.
  - Probably shows the Local views too.
