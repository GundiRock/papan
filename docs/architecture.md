- Client/Server architecture.
  - Probably using gRPC.
  - Nice to have: webcams headshots.
  - Desktop / web browser / Android / iOS clients.
    - Not sure if Android / iOS clients only fullscreen webpages.
      - Native "clients" could just be running web view.
      - The native client would help connecting to a lobby.
      - Using [SSPD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Service_Discovery_Protocol), a Desktop server could advertize its URLs to the clients.
- Notion of Global / Local views.
  - Global = the board visible by everyone, including spectators.
  - Local = player's hands and UI.
  - Should have the notion of having a proper overlay for the Local view into the Global.
  - Global board should still be interactive, but only on each player's "turn".
    - Preemptivity of turns to allow interruptions.
- Server in node.js.
  - May be a REST / Websocket gateway for web clients.
  - Possibility to run it as an electron app for Desktops.
  - Spawns game instances (only one in electron).
    - Needs to be scalable, potentially on more than one machine.
    - Lobby server plays the role of the gateway.
    - gRPC uds sockets between the two, if possible ?
- Need to make sure that disconnection and client crash is recoverable.
  - A reconnection should send the full current state of the Global and Local view (for non-spectators).
- Game logic in Javascript.
  - Maybe have an example using emscripten to demonstrate that Javascript isn't necessarily the only programming language available.
    - Maybe create a Lua framework for people who prefer Lua over Javascript ? But not at first.
- Game "packages" containing server JS code, client JS code, and assets.
  - Means we can't trust the packages. Should warn users about that.
  - Packages should only be installed by server admins.
  - Could packages be actual npm packages ? That'd solve hosting a bit.
    - We could have true dependency trees, such as having a "52 cards" deck assets, or basic libraries.
  - We probably don't want to run a "main" game lobby for everyone, for cost and copyright reasons (if anyone uploads copyrighted material - we don't want to need a DMCA response team).
    - We could provide a default one, but clients should be allowed to store their preferred game servers.
    - The default lobby we'd run should only have basic games (Poker, Game of the Goose, etc...)
- User accounts.
  - Simply using Google auth for login maybe ? Or have pluggable auth, with a default on Google auth.
  - Favorite servers ? Or do we keep that in each game clients ?
  - Limited persistent storage per game package ? A bit like Steam Cloud.
- Replayability / game session recording.
  - Needs to have replayable "game states", aka the game server only retraces / resends events that happened (gRPC messages could be enough ?), and game clients become non-interactive.
  - Probably shows the Local views too.
    - Playback should then let you selects which Local view to display.
- Not really different from any typical node.js app. The key to success is probably going to be in the provided libraries.
  - Good and strong messaging framework. Need to bikeshed about how to properly handle replays.
  - Strong base libraries for dealing with very common things like cards, decks, hands, dices, tokens, etc...
